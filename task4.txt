Based on the startup list on Y combinator website I note that :
1. Start-ups are great orroptunity to learn and work towards enhancement of the skills as it allows you to experiment on their product.
2. Start-ups are small group of passionate people open to exercising new ideas and hence gives a chance to grow as an indivisual.
3. Working from the start of a product helps give better understanding of the product and thereby creating a better work environment.
